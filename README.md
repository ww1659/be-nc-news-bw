# Northcoders News API

Good day! Before running this project you will need to add the following files to your file system:

.env.test
.env.development

In these files, you will specify which database you want to connect to by writing the following into each file respectively:

PGDATABASE=nc_news_test (write this line into the .env.test file)
PGDATABASE=nc_news (write this line into the .env.development file)

Cheers!
